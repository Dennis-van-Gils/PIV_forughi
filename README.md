# Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) Code
A flexible and hackable Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) code in Python and Matlab.


# Notes:
- The Python version of the code (Python_Code.py) has been updated significantly. The Matlab version is relatively older. Please use the Python code if you can.
- In some cases, Numba makes the code run much faster (up to 2.2 times). If you don't want to use Numba, comment lines 12 and 15.
